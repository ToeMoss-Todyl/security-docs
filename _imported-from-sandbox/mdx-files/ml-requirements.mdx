<div id="ml-requirements"></div>

To run and create ((ml)) jobs and rules, you need all of these:

* The [appropriate license](((subscriptions)))
* There must be at least one ((ml)) node in your cluster
* The `machine_learning_admin` user role

For more information, go to [Set up ((ml-features))](((ml-docs))/setup.html).

<DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">

The `machine_learning_admin` and `machine_learning_user` built-in roles give
access to the results of _all_ ((anomaly-jobs)), irrespective of whether the user
has access to the source indices. Likewise, a user who has full or read-only
access to ((ml-features)) within a given ((kib)) space can view the results of _all_
((anomaly-jobs)) that are visible in that space. You must carefully consider who
is given these roles and feature privileges; ((anomaly-job)) results may propagate
field values that contain sensitive information from the source indices to the
results.
