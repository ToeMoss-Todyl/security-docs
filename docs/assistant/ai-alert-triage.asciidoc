= Triage Alerts with Elastic AI Assistant
Elastic AI Assistant can help you enhance and streamline your alert triage workflows. 

AI Assistant can help you interpret an alert and understand its context. When you view an alert in {elastic-sec}, details such as related documents, hosts, and users appear alongside a synopsis of the events that triggered the alert. This data provides a starting point for understanding a potential threat. AI Assistant can answer questions about this data and offer insights and actionable recommendations to remediate the issue.

== Generate triage reports
Elastic AI Assistant can streamline the process of documentation and report generation, helping you provide stakeholders clear records of security incidents, including their scope and impact, and your remediation efforts. You can use AI Assistant to create summaries or reports that include key event details, findings, and diagrams. Once the AI Assistant has finished analyzing one or more alerts, you can generate reports by using prompts such as:

* “Generate a detailed report about this incident including timeline, impact analysis, and response actions. Also, include a diagram of events.”
* “Generate a summary of this incident/alert and include diagrams of events.”
* “Provide more details on the mitigation strategies used.”

After reviewing the report, you can add it to a case to keep a record and make it available to your team by clicking **Add to existing case** at the top of AI Assistant's response:
