== Use placeholder fields in Osquery queries 

Use placeholder fields to dynamically inject alert and event data into queries when you run them. All Osquery fields can be placeholder fields. You can use placeholder fields in single queries and query packs. 

Placeholder fields use http://mustache.github.io/[mustache syntax] ({{}}) (for example {{host.name}}) and can be used in <<pf-invest-guide-osquery,Investigation Guides>> and <<pf-osq-response-action-osquery,Osquery Response Actions>>.

=== Use placeholder fields in Investigation Guides 

You can add placeholder fields to Osquery queries within an <<invest-guide-run-osquery,Investigation Guide>> when creating or editing a rule. Make sure to run the Investigation Guide from alerts that are generated by the rule and not the rule itself.
