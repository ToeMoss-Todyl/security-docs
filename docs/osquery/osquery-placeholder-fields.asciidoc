== Use placeholder fields in Osquery queries 

Placeholder fields dynamically inject alert and event data into Osquery queries at runtime. Placeholder fields use mustache syntax and must be wrapped in double curly brackets (`{{}}`); you can turn any field in an event or alert document into a placeholder field. 

Placeholder fields work in single queries and query packs. If you are running a live query that has placeholder fields, _you must run it from an alert or event_. Also note that placeholder fields within an Osquery Response Action query will only work if the rule has generated alerts.

If the placeholder field is unable to find a value for the field in the alert or event's document, the query status will be `Skipped` and the following error message displays:

=== Example query using a placeholder field
Here is an example query that uses the `{{host.name}}` placeholder field:

`SELECT * FROM os_version WHERE name = `{{host.name}}

When this query is ran, it will select all columns from the `os_version` table where `name` is the value that's available in the alert or event's `host.name` field.
