== Use placeholder fields in Osquery queries 

Placeholder fields are fields that can be replaced with data about an alert or an event. You can use placeholder fields to turn hard-coded queries into dynamic, flexible ones. Any field within an event or alert document can be used as a placeholder field. Placeholder fields work in single queries or query packs.

=== Placeholder field syntax

Placeholder fields use http://mustache.github.io/[mustache syntax] and must be wrapped in double curly brackets (`{{}}`). In the following example query, the `{{host.name}}` placeholder field is being used: 

`SELECT * FROM os_version WHERE name = `{{host.name}}`

When the query is ran, the `{{host.name}}` field will be replaced with the value that's stored in the alert or event's `host.name` field.

=== Run queries with placeholder fields

Queries with placeholder fields _must_ be run against an alert or event. If a placeholder field can't find an alert or event value, the query status will be `Skipped`. 

Placeholder fields are supported for the following features:

* <<alerts-run-osquery,Live queries>>
* <<osquery-response-action,Osquery Response Action>>
+
NOTE: Placeholder fields within an Osquery Response Action query will only work if the rule has generated alerts.
