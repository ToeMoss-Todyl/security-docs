== View and analyze risk score data

The {security-app} provides several options to monitor the change in the risk posture of hosts and users from your environment. We recommend that you prioritize alert triaging to identify anomalies or abnormal behavior patterns.

Use the following places in the {security-app} to view and analyze risk score data:

=== Entity Analytics dashboard
