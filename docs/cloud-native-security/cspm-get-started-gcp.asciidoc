== Overview

This page explains how to get started monitoring the security posture of your cloud assets using the Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) feature.

.Requirements
[sidebar]
--
* The CSPM integration is available to all {ecloud} users. On-premise deployments require an https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Enterprise subscription].
* To view posture data, you need `read` privileges for the following {es} indices:
** `logs-cloud_security_posture.findings_latest-*`
** `logs-cloud_security_posture.scores-*`
** `Logs-cloud_security_posture.findings`
* The user who gives the CSPM integration GCP permissions must be a GCP project `admin`.

== Set up CSPM for GCP

To set up CSPM for GCP, first add the CSPM integration, then enable cloud account access.

[[cspm-add-and-name-integration-gcp]]
=== Add your CSPM integration
. From the Elastic Security *Get started* page, click *Add integrations*.
. Search for `CSPM`, then click on the result.
. Click *Add Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)*.
. Give your integration a name that matches the purpose or team of the GCP account you want to monitor, for example, `dev-aws-account`.

=== Set up cloud account access
The CSPM integration requires admin access to your GCP project to

For most users, the simplest option is to use a Google Cloud Shell script to automatically provision the necessary resources and permissions in your GCP account. This method, as well as two manual options, are described below.

[[cspm-set-up-cloudshell]]
=== Cloud Shell script setup (recommended)

. Under **Setup Access** select **Google Cloud Shell**.
. Under **Where to add this integration**,
  . If you want to monitor a GCP project where you have not yet deployed {agent}:
    . Select **New Hosts**
    . Name the {agent} policy. Use a name that matches the purpose or team of the cloud account or accounts you want to monitor. For example, `dev-gcp-account`.
    . Click **Save and continue**, then **Add {agent} to your hosts**. The **Add agent** wizard appears and provides {agent} binaries, which you can download and deploy to a VM in your GCP account.
  . If you want to monitor a GCP project where you have already deployed {agent}:
    . Select **Existing hosts**.
    . Select an agent policy that applies the GCP project you want to monitor.
. Click **Save and continue**.
. Copy the command that appears, then click **Launch Google Cloud Shell**. It opens in a new window.
. Check the box to trust Elastic's `cloudbeat` repo, then click **Continue**

[[cspm-set-up-manual-gcp]]
=== Manual setup

. Under **Setup Access** select **Manual**.
. Enter your GCP **Project ID**.
. Select either **Credentials File** or **Credentials JSON**.
. Enter the credentials information in your selected format.
. Under **Where to add this integration**,
  . If you want to monitor a GCP project where you have not yet deployed {agent}:
    . Select **New Hosts**
    . Name the {agent} policy. Use a name that matches the purpose or team of the cloud account or accounts you want to monitor. For example, `dev-gcp-account`.
