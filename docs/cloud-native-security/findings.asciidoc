[[findings-page-what-are-findings]]
=== What are findings?

Findings indicate whether Kubernetes resources passed or failed evaluation against benchmark rules. Each finding includes metadata about the resource evaluated and the benchmark rule used to evaluate it.
Each finding's result (`pass` or `fail`) indicates whether a particular part of your Kubernetes infrastructure meets a benchmark rule.

[[findings-page-group-filter]]
=== Group and filter findings
By default, the findings page lists all findings, without grouping or filtering.

[discrete]
==== Group findings by resource:*

. Click the *Group by* menu near the search box and select *Resource* to view a list of resources sorted by their total number of failed findings.
. Click a resource ID to view the findings associated with that resource.

[discrete]
==== Filter findings
You can filter findings data in two ways:

. The KQL search bar. For example, search for `result.evaluation : failed` to view all failed findings.
. In-table value filters. Hover over a finding to view plus and minus buttons. The plus button filters for the associated value, while the minus button filters it out.

[[findings-page-remediate-findings]]
=== Remediate failed findings
To remediate failed findings and reduce your attack surface:

. Navigate to the findings page and filter for failed findings, as described above.
. Click a failed finding to open the findings flyout.
. Follow the steps under *Remediation*.

NOTE: Remediation steps typically include commands for you to execute. These sometimes contain placeholder values that you must replace before execution.
