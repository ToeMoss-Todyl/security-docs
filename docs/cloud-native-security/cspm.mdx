<div id="cspm"></div>

The Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) feature discovers and evaluates the services in your cloud environment — like storage, compute, IAM, and more — against configuration security guidelines defined by the [Center for Internet Security](https://www.cisecurity.org/) (CIS) to help you identify and remediate risks that could undermine the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your cloud data.

This feature currently supports Amazon Web Services (AWS). For a step-by-step getting started guide, refer to <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityCspmGetStarted">Get started with CSPM</DocLink>.

<DocCallOut title="Requirements">

* The CSPM integration is available to all ((ecloud)) users. On-premise deployments require an [Enterprise subscription](https://www.elastic.co/pricing).
* ((stack)) version 8.7 or greater.

## How CSPM works

To set up the CSPM feature, you'll install the CSPM integration for ((agent)) in your cloud account(s).

Using the read-only credentials you will provide during the setup process, it will evaluate the configuration of resources in your environment every 4 hours.
After each evaluation, the integration sends findings to Elastic. A high-level summary of the findings appears on the <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityCloudNatSecPostureDashboard">Cloud posture dashboard</DocLink>, and detailed findings appear on the <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityFindingsPage">Findings page</DocLink>.
