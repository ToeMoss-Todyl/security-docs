At the top of the dashboard, 5 summary cards appear. They display the number of monitored cloud accounts, scanned virtual machines (VMs), and vulnerabilities (grouped by severity).

The *Trend by severity* bar graph complements the summary cards by displaying the number of vulnerabilities found on your infrastructure over time, sorted by severity. It has a maximum time scale of 30 days.

The page also includes three tables:

* *Top 10 vulnerable resources* shows your VMs with the highest number of vulnerabilities.
* *Top 10 patchable vulnerabilities* shows the most common vulnerabilities in your environment that can be fixed by a software update.
* *Top 10 vulnerabilities* shows the most common vulnerabilities in your environment, with additional details.

Each table includes a *View all vulnerabilities* button that opens the <<vuln-management-findings, Vulnerabilities Findings>> page, where you can view additional details.
