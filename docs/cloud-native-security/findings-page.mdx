## What are KSPM findings?

KSPM findings indicate whether a given resource passed or failed evaluation against a specific security guideline. Each finding includes metadata about the resource evaluated and the security guideline used to evaluate it. Each finding's result (`pass` or `fail`) indicates whether a particular part of your infrastructure meets a security guideline.

## Group and filter findings
By default, the Findings page lists all findings, without grouping or filtering.

### Group findings by resource

1. Select **Group by** -> **Resource** to display a list of resources sorted by their total number of failed findings.
1. Click a resource ID to display the findings associated with that resource.

<div id="findings-page-filter-findings"></div>

### Filter findings
You can filter findings data in two ways:

* **The KQL search bar**: For example, search for `result.evaluation : failed` to view all failed findings.
* **In-table value filters**: Hover over a finding to display available inline actions. Use the Filter In (plus) and Filter Out (minus) buttons.

1. Navigate to the Findings page and <DocLink id="enSecurityFindingsPage" section="filter-findings">filter for failed findings</DocLink>.
1. Click a failed finding to open the findings flyout.
1. Follow the steps under **Remediation**.
