= Findings

The vulnerabilities findings page displays the vulnerabilities detected by the <<vuln-management-overview, Elastic Vulnerability Management for Cloud (EVMC) integration>>. EVMC findings include metadata such as the CVE identifier, CVSS score, severity, affected package, and fix version if available, as well as information about impacted systems.

To help you prioritize remediation efforts, you can filter and sort your findings based on these fields. Clicking on a finding provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, and any available remediation information.
