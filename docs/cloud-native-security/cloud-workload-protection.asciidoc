<<session-view,*Session view*>> is an investigation tool that allows you to examine Linux process data organized in a tree-like structure according to the Linux logical event model, with processes organized by parentage and time of execution. It displays events in a highly readable format that is inspired by the terminal. This makes it a powerful tool for monitoring and investigating session activity on your Linux infrastructure and understanding user and service behavior. You can use session view on the *Hosts*, *Alerts*, and *Timeline* pages, as well as from the *Kubernetes dashboard*.

<<cloud-nat-sec-kubernetes-dashboard,*The Kubernetes dashboard*>> provides insight into Linux process data from your Kubernetes clusters. It shows sessions in the context of your Kubernetes infrastructure.
