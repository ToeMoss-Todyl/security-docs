= Benchmark rules
The Benchmark Integrations page helps you view and manage the CSP benchmark rules that are active for each of your <<kspm, KSPM integrations>>. Benchmark rules define security best practices for Kubernetes configuration, and form the basis of <<kspm, Findings>>.

To find this page, go to **Security -> Manage -> CSP Benchmarks**. From there, to view the benchmark rules associated with a particular integration, click that integration's name. You can then click on a benchmark rule's name to see details, including information about how to remediate failures, and related links.

You can't edit benchmark rules, but you can enable and disable them for each integration policy. They default to `Enabled`. You can enable or disable them individually, or in bulk by using the *Bulk Actions* menu.
