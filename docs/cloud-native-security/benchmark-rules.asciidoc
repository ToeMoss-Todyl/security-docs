== Benchmark rules
The Benchmark Integrations page lets you view the cloud security posture (CSP) benchmark rules for the <<kspm, Kubernetes security posture management>> (KSPM) integration.

Benchmark rules are used by the Kubernetes Security Posture Management integration to identify configuration risks in Kubernetes. Benchmark rules are based on the Center for Internet Security's (CIS) https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/[secure configuration benchmarks for Kubernetes].

Each benchmark rule checks to see if a specific Kubernetes resource is configured according to a CIS Benchmark. For example:

* Ensure Kubernetes Secrets are encrypted using Customer Master Keys (CMKs) managed in AWS KMS
* Ensure the default namespace is not in use

When benchmark rules are evaluated, the resulting <<findings-page, findings>> data appears on the <<cloud-posture-dashboard, Cloud Posture dashboard>>.

To find the Benchmark Integrations page, go to **Manage -> CSP Benchmarks**. From there, you can view the benchmark rules associated with an existing integration by clicking its name, or create one if you haven't yet.

You can then click on a benchmark rule's name to see details, including information about how to remediate failures and related links.

NOTE: Benchmark rules are not editable.

=== How benchmark rules work

. When the KSPM integration is deployed, and every four hours after that, {agent} fetches relevant Kubernetes resources.
. Once a resource has been fetched, it is evaluated against all applicable benchmark rules.
. Finding values of `pass` or `fail` indicate whether a resource passed a benchmark rule.

=== FAQ

*Do benchmark rules cover multiple Kubernetes deployment types?*
Yes. There are benchmark rule sets for self-managed and EKS-managed deployments.


*How often are my resources evaluated with benchmark rules?*
Resources are fetched and evaluated with benchmark rules every four hours.


*Can I configure the KSPM integration's fetch cycle?*
No, the fetch cycle is not configurable.

*Can I contribute to the CSP ruleset?*
You can't directly edit benchmark rules. The rules are defined https://github.com/elastic/csp-security-policies[in this repository], where you can raise issues with certain rules. They are written in https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/[Rego].
