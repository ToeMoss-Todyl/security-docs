= Benchmark rules
The Benchmark Integrations page helps you view and manage the cloud security posture (CSP) benchmark rules that are active for each of your <<kspm, Kubernetes security posture management (KSPM) integrations>>. Benchmark rules define security best practices for Kubernetes configuration, and form the basis of the results on the <<kspm, Findings page>>.

To view the benchmark rules associated with a policy, click that policy's name. You can then click on a benchmark rule's name to see details, including information about how to remediate failures, and related links.

You can't edit benchmark rules, but you can enable and disable them for each {agent} integration policy. They default to `Enabled`. You can enable or disable them individually, or in bulk with the *Bulk Actions* menu.
