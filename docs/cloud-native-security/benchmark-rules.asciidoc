== Benchmark rules
The Benchmark Integrations page lets you view the cloud security posture (CSP) benchmark rules for your <<kspm, Kubernetes security posture management (KSPM) integrations>>.

Benchmark rules are used by the Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) Integration to identify configuration risks in Kubernetes. Benchmark rules are based on the Center for Internet Security's (CIS) https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/[secure configuration benchmarks for Kubernetes].

Each benchmark rule checks to see if a specific Kubernetes resource is configured according to a CIS Benchmark. For example:

* Ensure Kubernetes Secrets are encrypted using Customer Master Keys (CMKs) managed in AWS KMS
* Ensure the default namespace is not in use

When benchmark rules are evaluated, the resulting <<findings-page, findings>> data appears on the <<cloud-posture-dashboard, Cloud Posture dashboard>>.

To find the Benchmark Integrations page, go to **Manage -> CSP Benchmarks**. From there, you can add a new KSPM integration, or view the benchmark rules associated with an existing one by clicking its name.

You can then click on a benchmark rule's name to see details, including information about how to remediate failures and related links.

=== How benchmark rules work

. When a KSPM integration is deployed, and every 4 hours after that, it fetches relevant Kubernetes resources.
. Once a resource has been fetched, it is evaluated against all applicable benchmark rules.
. `failed` findings indicate that a resource failed a benchmark rule.
. `passed` findings indicate that a resource passed a benchmark rule.

=== FAQ

*Do benchmark rules cover multiple Kubernetes deployment types?*
Yes. There are benchmark rule sets for self-managed and EKS-managed deployments.

+

*How often are my resources evaluated with benchmark rules?*
Resources are fetched and evaluated with benchmark rules every four hours.

+

*Can I configure the KSPM integration's fetch cycle?*
No, the fetch cycle is not configurable.
