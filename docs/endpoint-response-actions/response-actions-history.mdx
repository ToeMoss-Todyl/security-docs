((elastic-defend)) keeps a log of the <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityResponseActions">response actions</DocLink> performed on endpoints, such as isolating a host or terminating a process. The log displays when each command was performed, the host on which the action was performed, the user who requested the action, any comments added to the action, and the action's current status.

To access the response actions history for all endpoints, go to **Assets** â†’ **Response actions history**. You can also access the response actions history for an individual endpoint from these areas:

* **Endpoints** page: Click an endpoint's name to open the details flyout, then click the **Response actions history** tab.
* **Response console** page: Click the **Response actions history** button.

All of these contexts contain the same information and features. The following image shows the **Response actions history** page for all endpoints:
