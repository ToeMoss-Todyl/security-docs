Collect and share information about security issues by opening a case in ((elastic-sec)). Cases allow you to track key investigation details, collect alerts in a central location, and more. The ((elastic-sec)) UI provides several ways to create and manage cases. Alternatively, you can use the <DocLink id="enSecurityCasesApiOverview">cases API</DocLink> to perform the same tasks.

You can also send cases to these external systems by <DocLink id="enSecurityCasesUiIntegrations">configuring external connectors</DocLink>:

* ((sn-itsm))
* ((sn-sir))
* ((jira)) (including Jira Service Desk)
* ((ibm-r))
* ((swimlane))
* ((webhook-cm))
