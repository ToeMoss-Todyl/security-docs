Collect and share information about security issues by opening a case in ((elastic-sec)). Cases allow you to track key investigation details, collect alerts in a central location, and more. The ((elastic-sec)) UI provides several ways to create and manage cases. 
{/* The following sentence is commented out because Security APIs are not yet available for Serverless. 
Once the API is available, we can uncomment it (and add back to the preceding paragraph). */}
{/* Alternatively, you can use the <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityCasesApiOverview">cases API</DocLink> to perform the same tasks. */}

You can also send cases to these external systems by <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityCasesUiIntegrations">configuring external connectors</DocLink>:
