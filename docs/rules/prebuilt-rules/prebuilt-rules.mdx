On Windows, the only process that normally performs Kerberos traffic from a domain joined host is lsass.exe. | [Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Windows], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Credential Access], [Resources: Investigation Guide] | 8.3.0 | 106 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityKernelLoadOrUnloadViaKexecDetected">Kernel Load or Unload via Kexec Detected</DocLink> | This detection rule identifies the usage of kexec, helping to uncover unauthorized kernel replacements and potential compromise of the system's integrity. Kexec is a Linux feature that enables the loading and execution of a different kernel without going through the typical boot process. Malicious actors can abuse kexec to bypass security measures, escalate privileges, establish persistence or hide their activities by loading a malicious kernel, enabling them to tamper with the system's trusted state, allowing e.g. a VM Escape. | [Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Linux], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Persistence], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation], [Tactic: Defense Evasion] | 8.3.0 | 1 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityKernelModuleRemoval">Kernel Module Removal</DocLink> | Kernel modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. This rule identifies attempts to remove a kernel module. | [Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Linux], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Defense Evasion], [Data Source: Elastic Endgame] | 8.3.0 | 104 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityKernelModuleLoadViaInsmod">Kernel module load via insmod</DocLink> | Detects the use of the insmod binary to load a Linux kernel object file. Threat actors can use this binary, given they have root privileges, to load a rootkit on a system providing them with complete control and the ability to hide from security products. Manually loading a kernel module in this manner should not be at all common and can indicate suspcious or malicious behavior. | [Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Linux], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Persistence], [Threat: Rootkit], [Data Source: Elastic Endgame] | 8.3.0 | 104 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityKeychainPasswordRetrievalViaCommandLine">Keychain Password Retrieval via Command Line</DocLink> | Adversaries may collect keychain storage data from a system to in order to acquire credentials. Keychains are the built-in way for macOS to keep track of users' passwords and credentials for many services and features, including Wi-Fi and website passwords, secure notes, certificates, and Kerberos. | [Domain: Endpoint], [OS: macOS], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Credential Access] | 8.3.0 | 103 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityKubernetesAnonymousRequestAuthorized">Kubernetes Anonymous Request Authorized</DocLink> | This rule detects when an unauthenticated user request is authorized within the cluster. Attackers may attempt to use anonymous accounts to gain initial access to the cluster or to avoid attribution of their activities within the cluster. This rule excludes the /healthz, /livez and /readyz endpoints which are commonly accessed anonymously. | [Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Initial Access], [Tactic: Defense Evasion] | 8.4.0 | 5 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityKubernetesContainerCreatedWithExcessiveLinuxCapabilities">Kubernetes Container Created with Excessive Linux Capabilities</DocLink> | This rule detects a container deployed with one or more dangerously permissive Linux capabilities. An attacker with the ability to deploy a container with added capabilities could use this for further execution, lateral movement, or privilege escalation within a cluster. The capabilities detected in this rule have been used in container escapes to the host machine. | [Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] | 8.4.0 | 3 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityKubernetesDeniedServiceAccountRequest">Kubernetes Denied Service Account Request</DocLink> | This rule detects when a service account makes an unauthorized request for resources from the API server. Service accounts follow a very predictable pattern of behavior. A service account should never send an unauthorized request to the API server. This behavior is likely an indicator of compromise or of a problem within the cluster. An adversary may have gained access to credentials/tokens and this could be an attempt to access or create resources to facilitate further movement or execution within the cluster. | [Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Discovery] | 8.4.0 | 4 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityKubernetesExposedServiceCreatedWithTypeNodeport">Kubernetes Exposed Service Created With Type NodePort</DocLink> | This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a service as type NodePort. The NodePort service allows a user to externally expose a set of labeled pods to the internet. This creates an open port on every worker node in the cluster that has a pod for that service. When external traffic is received on that open port, it directs it to the specific pod through the service representing it. A malicious user can configure a service as type Nodeport in order to intercept traffic from other pods or nodes, bypassing firewalls and other network security measures configured for load balancers within a cluster. This creates a direct method of communication between the cluster and the outside world, which could be used for more malicious behavior and certainly widens the attack surface of your cluster. | [Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Persistence] | 8.4.0 | 202 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityKubernetesPodCreatedWithHostipc">Kubernetes Pod Created With HostIPC</DocLink> | This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a pod using the host IPC namespace. This gives access to data used by any pod that also use the hosts IPC namespace. If any process on the host or any processes in a pod uses the hosts inter-process communication mechanisms (shared memory, semaphore arrays, message queues, etc.), an attacker can read/write to those same mechanisms. They may look for files in /dev/shm or use ipcs to check for any IPC facilities being used. | [Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] | 8.4.0 | 202 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityKubernetesPodCreatedWithHostnetwork">Kubernetes Pod Created With HostNetwork</DocLink> | This rules detects an attempt to create or modify a pod attached to the host network. HostNetwork allows a pod to use the node network namespace. Doing so gives the pod access to any service running on localhost of the host. An attacker could use this access to snoop on network activity of other pods on the same node or bypass restrictive network policies applied to its given namespace. | [Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] | 8.4.0 | 202 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityKubernetesPodCreatedWithHostpid">Kubernetes Pod Created With HostPID</DocLink> | This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a pod attached to the host PID namespace. HostPID allows a pod to access all the processes running on the host and could allow an attacker to take malicious action. When paired with ptrace this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container. When paired with a privileged container, the pod can see all of the processes on the host. An attacker can enter the init system (PID 1) on the host. From there, they could execute a shell and continue to escalate privileges to root. | [Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] | 8.4.0 | 202 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityKubernetesPodCreatedWithASensitiveHostpathVolume">Kubernetes Pod created with a Sensitive hostPath Volume</DocLink> | This rule detects when a pod is created with a sensitive volume of type hostPath. A hostPath volume type mounts a sensitive file or folder from the node to the container. If the container gets compromised, the attacker can use this mount for gaining access to the node. There are many ways a container with unrestricted access to the host filesystem can escalate privileges, including reading data from other containers, and accessing tokens of more privileged pods. | [Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] | 8.4.0 | 202 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityKubernetesPrivilegedPodCreated">Kubernetes Privileged Pod Created</DocLink> | This rule detects when a user creates a pod/container running in privileged mode. A highly privileged container has access to the node's resources and breaks the isolation between containers. If compromised, an attacker can use the privileged container to gain access to the underlying host. Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence, moving laterally within the environment, or setting up a command and control channel on the host. | [Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] | 8.4.0 | 202 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityKubernetesSuspiciousAssignmentOfControllerServiceAccount">Kubernetes Suspicious Assignment of Controller Service Account</DocLink> | This rule detects a request to attach a controller service account to an existing or new pod running in the kube-system namespace. By default, controllers running as part of the API Server utilize admin-equivalent service accounts hosted in the kube-system namespace. Controller service accounts aren't normally assigned to running pods and could indicate adversary behavior within the cluster. An attacker that can create or modify pods or pod controllers in the kube-system namespace, can assign one of these admin-equivalent service accounts to a pod and abuse their powerful token to escalate privileges and gain complete cluster control. | [Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] | 8.4.0 | 5 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityKubernetesSuspiciousSelfSubjectReview">Kubernetes Suspicious Self-Subject Review</DocLink> | This rule detects when a service account or node attempts to enumerate their own permissions via the selfsubjectaccessreview or selfsubjectrulesreview APIs. This is highly unusual behavior for non-human identities like service accounts and nodes. An adversary may have gained access to credentials/tokens and this could be an attempt to determine what privileges they have to facilitate further movement or execution within the cluster. | [Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Discovery] | 8.4.0 | 202 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityKubernetesUserExecIntoPod">Kubernetes User Exec into Pod</DocLink> | This rule detects a user attempt to establish a shell session into a pod using the 'exec' command. Using the 'exec' command in a pod allows a user to establish a temporary shell session and execute any process/commands in the pod. An adversary may call bash to gain a persistent interactive shell which will allow access to any data the pod has permissions to, including secrets. | [Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution] | 8.4.0 | 202 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityLsassMemoryDumpCreation">LSASS Memory Dump Creation</DocLink> | Identifies the creation of a Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (lsass.exe) default memory dump. This may indicate a credential access attempt via trusted system utilities such as Task Manager (taskmgr.exe) and SQL Dumper (sqldumper.exe) or known pentesting tools such as Dumpert and AndrewSpecial. | [Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Windows], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Credential Access], [Data Source: Elastic Endgame], [Resources: Investigation Guide] | 8.3.0 | 105 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityLsassMemoryDumpHandleAccess">LSASS Memory Dump Handle Access</DocLink> | Identifies handle requests for the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) object access with specific access masks that many tools with a capability to dump memory to disk use (0x1fffff, 0x1010, 0x120089). This rule is tool agnostic as it has been validated against a host of various LSASS dump tools such as SharpDump, Procdump, Mimikatz, Comsvcs etc. It detects this behavior at a low level and does not depend on a specific tool or dump file name. | [Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Windows], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Credential Access], [Resources: Investigation Guide] | 8.3.0 | 108 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityLsassProcessAccessViaWindowsApi">LSASS Process Access via Windows API</DocLink> | Identifies access attempts to the LSASS handle, which may indicate an attempt to dump credentials from LSASS memory. | [Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Windows], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Credential Access] | 8.7.0 | 2 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityLateralMovementViaStartupFolder">Lateral Movement via Startup Folder</DocLink> | Identifies suspicious file creations in the startup folder of a remote system. An adversary could abuse this to move laterally by dropping a malicious script or executable that will be executed after a reboot or user logon. | [Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Windows], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Lateral Movement], [Data Source: Elastic Endgame] | 8.3.0 | 103 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityLaunchAgentCreationOrModificationAndImmediateLoading">Launch Agent Creation or Modification and Immediate Loading</DocLink> | An adversary can establish persistence by installing a new launch agent that executes at login by using launchd or launchctl to load a plist into the appropriate directories. | [Domain: Endpoint], [OS: macOS], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Persistence] | 8.3.0 | 103 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityLaunchdaemonCreationOrModificationAndImmediateLoading">LaunchDaemon Creation or Modification and Immediate Loading</DocLink> | Indicates the creation or modification of a launch daemon, which adversaries may use to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. | [Domain: Endpoint], [OS: macOS], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Persistence] | 8.3.0 | 103 |

| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityMsOfficeMacroSecurityRegistryModifications">MS Office Macro Security Registry Modifications</DocLink> | Microsoft Office Products offer options for users and developers to control the security settings for running and using Macros. Adversaries may abuse these security settings to modify the default behavior of the Office Application to trust future macros and/or disable security warnings, which could increase their chances of establishing persistence. | [Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Windows], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Defense Evasion], [Resources: Investigation Guide], [Data Source: Elastic Endgame] | 8.3.0 | 105 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityMacosInstallerPackageSpawnsNetworkEvent">MacOS Installer Package Spawns Network Event</DocLink> | Detects the execution of a MacOS installer package with an abnormal child process (e.g bash) followed immediately by a network connection via a suspicious process (e.g curl). Threat actors will build and distribute malicious MacOS installer packages, which have a .pkg extension, many times imitating valid software in order to persuade and infect their victims often using the package files (e.g pre/post install scripts etc.) to download additional tools or malicious software. If this rule fires it should indicate the installation of a malicious or suspicious package. | [Domain: Endpoint], [OS: macOS], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Command and Control] | 8.3.0 | 103 |

| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityMasqueradingSpaceAfterFilename">Masquerading Space After Filename</DocLink> | This rules identifies a process created from an executable with a space appended to the end of the filename. This may indicate an attempt to masquerade a malicious file as benign to gain user execution. When a space is added to the end of certain files, the OS will execute the file according to it's true filetype instead of it's extension. Adversaries can hide a program's true filetype by changing the extension of the file. They can then add a space to the end of the name so that the OS automatically executes the file when it's double-clicked. | [Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Linux], [OS: macOS], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Defense Evasion] | 8.3.0 | 3 |
| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityMicrosoft365ExchangeAntiPhishPolicyDeletion">Microsoft 365 Exchange Anti-Phish Policy Deletion</DocLink> | Identifies the deletion of an anti-phishing policy in Microsoft 365.

| <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityZoomMeetingWithNoPasscode">Zoom Meeting with no Passcode</DocLink> | This rule identifies Zoom meetings that are created without a passcode. Meetings without a passcode are susceptible to Zoombombing. Zoombombing is carried out by taking advantage of Zoom sessions that are not protected with a passcode. Zoombombing refers to the unwanted, disruptive intrusion, generally by Internet trolls and hackers, into a video conference call. In a typical Zoombombing incident, a teleconferencing session is hijacked by the insertion of material that is lewd, obscene, racist, or antisemitic in nature, typically resulting of the shutdown of the session. | [Data Source: Zoom], [Use Case: Configuration Audit], [Tactic: Initial Access] | 8.3.0 | 101 |
