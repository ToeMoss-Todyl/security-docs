You can use these APIs to interface with ((elastic-sec)) features:

<DocCallOut title="Note">
Console supports sending requests to ((kib)) APIs. Prepend any ((kib)) API endpoint with `kbn:` and send the request via Console. For example:
`GET kbn:/api/index_management/indices`
</DocCallOut>

* <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityRuleApiOverview" />: Manage detection rules and alerts
* <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityExceptionsApiOverview">Exceptions API</DocLink>: Create and manage rule exceptions
* <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityListsApiOverview">Lists API</DocLink>: Create source event value lists for use with rule exceptions
* <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityTimelineApiOverview" />: Import and export timelines
* <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityCasesApiOverview" />: Open and manage cases

Additionally, the ((kib)) <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityActionsApiOverview">Actions API</DocLink> is partially
documented to enable opening and updating cases in external ticketing systems.
For more information on ((kib)) Actions, see
[Alerting and Actions](((kibana-ref))/alerting-getting-started.html) and
[action plugins](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/master/x-pack/plugins/actions).

## API URLs

For calls to the `Default` ((kib)) space, API endpoints are as follows:

`<kibana host>:<port>/api/<endpoint>`

Where:

* `<kibana host>` is the host name of your ((kib)) instance.
* `<port>` is port number of your ((kib)) instance.
* `<endpoint>` is the API endpoint, such as `detection_engine/rules` or
    `cases/configure`.

If you are making calls to a ((kib)) space **other than** the `Default` space, the
space identifier is part of the endpoint's URL:

`<kibana host>:<port>/s/<space URL>/api/<endpoint>`

Where `<space URL>` is the URL identifier for the ((kib)) space.

<DocCallOut title="Note">
You can find space URL identifiers on
[*Edit space*](((kibana-ref))/xpack-spaces.html) pages (Management → Spaces →
\<space name>) or by calling
[`GET /api/spaces/space`](((kibana-ref))/spaces-api-get-all.html).
</DocCallOut>

## Authentication

Token-based authentication, using the same username and password used to log in
to the Kibana UI, is required to access the APIs.

## API calls

All calls to APIs are stateless. Each call must include all the information
((elastic-sec)) needs to perform the request.

Requests must contain these headers:

* `kbn-xsrf: <value>`, where `<value>` can be any alphanumeric string (for
    example, `kbn-xsrf: kibana`)

* `Content-Type: application/json` (when the request contains a JSON payload)

For example, the following call uses the Detections API to retrieve the first
20 detection rules from the ((kib)) `siem` space:

```js
curl -X GET "<kibana host>:<port>/s/siem/api/detection_engine/rules/_find"
-H 'kbn-xsrf: kibana' -u <username>:<password>
```

<DocCallOut title="Note">
In dev mode, the Kibana server runs behind a proxy which adds a random
path component to its URL.
[Considerations for basePath](((kibana-ref))/development-basepath.html) describes
how to work with and disable the random path component.
