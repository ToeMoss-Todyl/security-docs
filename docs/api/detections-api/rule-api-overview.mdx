<div id="rule-api-overview"></div>

You can create rules that automatically turn events and external alerts sent to
((elastic-sec)) into detection alerts. These alerts are displayed on the Detections
page.

For more information about the differences between events,
external alerts, and detection alerts, see the
[Elastic Glossary](((glossary))/terms.html).

The API has these endpoints:

* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/rules` - Detection rules CRUD functions
* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/index` - Signal index operations
    (used to store detection alerts)

* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/tags` - Aggregates and returns rule
    tags

* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/rules/_import` - Imports rules from an
    `.ndjson` file

* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/rules/_export` - Exports rules to an
    `.ndjson` file

* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/privileges` - Returns the user's
    ((kib)) space and signal index permissions, and whether the user is authenticated

* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/signals` - Aggregates, queries, and
    returns alerts, and updates their statuses

* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged` - Loads and retrieves
    the status of Elastic <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityPrebuiltRules">prebuilt rules</DocLink>

## Kibana role requirements

To create and run rules, the user role for the ((kib)) space must have:

* ((kib)) space `All` privileges for the `Security` and `Saved Objects Management`
    features (see
    [Feature access based on user privileges](((kibana-ref))/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access)).

* `read` and `write` privileges for the `.siem-signals-*` index (the system index
    used for storing detection alerts created from rules).

See <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityDetectionsPermissionsSection">Detections prerequisites and requirements</DocLink> for a complete list of requirements.
