== Detection rules enhancements

*Alert suppression for custom query rules*

{security-guide}/alert-suppression.html[Alert suppression] allows you to reduce the number of repeated or duplicate detection alerts created by a custom query detection rule each time the rule runs. Matching events are grouped by a specified field, and only one alert is created for each group per rule execution. You can also specify multiple fields to group events by unique combinations of values. 

*{ml-cap} job management enhancements*

Several enhancements have been added to simplify managing {ml} detection rules and their associated {ml} jobs:

* Required {ml} jobs are automatically started when creating a new {ml} rule.
* The rule details page includes toggles to turn on {ml} jobs for existing rules.
* The Rules page displays additional information and an error icon to identify rules with {ml} jobs that aren't running.
