=== New features

*Malicious behavior protection for Linux, Windows, and macOS hosts*

<<behavior-protection, Malicious behavior protection>> detects and stops threats by monitoring the behavior of system processes for suspicious activity. It leverages existing malware and ransomware prevention with dynamic prevention of post-execution behavior. Malicious behavior is available for customers with a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or Enterprise license].

*Memory threat protection for Windows hosts*

<<memory-protection, Memory threat protection>> detects and stops many of the techniques used for process injection via shellcode, where an attacker attempts to avoid detection by executing an attack from memory instead of from on-disk, where most detection tools operate. Adversaries leverage in-memory attacks to evade common defensive technologies. {elastic-sec} also stops sub-techniques such as thread execution hijacking, asynchronous procedure call, process hollowing, and process doppelgänging. Memory threat protection is available for customers with a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or Enterprise license].

*Enhanced Alerts page view*

The Alerts page has several new enhancements, all designed to help triage alerts faster. A few of these include:

* Updated alert statuses (`Open`, `Acknowledged`, and `Closed`)
* New option to group alerts by specific parameters and view individual alert counts
* New options to customize the Alerts table view
* Enhanced threat intelligence data details

*Host isolation for all operating systems*

<<host-isolation-ov, Host isolation>>, which allows analysts to respond to malicious activity by isolating a host from a network, was introduced for Windows and macOS hosts in {stack} 7.14. In {stack}  7.15, this feature is now available for Linux hosts, making the feature compatible with all operating systems.

*Osquery Manager enhancements (beta)*

Osquery Manager contains the following new enhancements in {stack} 7.15. For detailed information about all of Osquery's features, see Kibana's {kibana-ref}/osquery.html[Osquery overview].

* *Access controls*
+
With this release, security teams have more control over who can access Osquery and view results, depending on whether you have a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Basic or Gold license].

* *Standardized, scheduled query results with ECS*
+
When defining scheduled queries, you can now map query results to ECS fields, allowing you to standardize your Osquery data to use across detections, machine learning, and any other areas that rely on ECS-compliant data.
+
* *Scheduled query status at a glance*
+
Scheduled query groups now show the status of individual queries within a group, which is helpful to quickly understand which issues may need to be addressed first. This information can also help analysts fine-tune queries and resolve any errors.
