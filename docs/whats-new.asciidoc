== Detection rules enhancements

*New UI for installing and upgrading prebuilt detection rules*

There's a {security-guide}/prebuilt-rules-management.html[newly redesigned UI] and workflow for managing prebuilt detection rules to allow more flexibility and visibility into rule updates. You can now select which prebuilt rules you want to install and update, instead of only installing the entire set of rules. You can also duplicate a rule to make changes to it.
