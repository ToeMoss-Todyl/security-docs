=== New features

*Malicious behavior protection for Linux, Windows, and macOS hosts*

<<malicious-behavior-protection, Malicious behavior protection>> detects and stops threats by monitoring the behavior of system processes for suspicious activity. It leverages existing malware and ransomware prevention with dynamic prevention of post-execution behavior. Malicious behavior is available for customers with a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or Enterprise license].

*Memory threat protection for Windows hosts*

<<memory-protection, Memory threat protection>> detects and stops many of the techniques used for process injection via shellcode, where an attacker attempts to avoid detection by executing an attack from memory instead of from on-disk, where most detection tools operate. Adversaries leverage in-memory attacks to evade common defensive technologies. {elastic-sec} also stops sub-techniques such as thread execution hijacking, asynchronous procedure call, process hollowing, and process doppelgänging. Memory threat protection is available for customers with a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or Enterprise license].

*Enhanced Alerts page*

The Alerts page has several new enhancements, all designed to help triage alerts faster. A few of these include:

* Updated alert statuses (`Open`, `Acknowledged`, `Closed`)

*Host isolation is available for all operating systems*

<<host-isolation-ov, Host isolation>>, which allows analysts to respond to malicious activity by isolating a host from a network, was introduced for Windows and macOS hosts in {stack} 7.14. In {stack} version 7.15, this feature is now available for Linux hosts, making the feature compatible with all operating systems.
