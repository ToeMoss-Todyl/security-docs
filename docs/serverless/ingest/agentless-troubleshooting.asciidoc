Frequently asked questions and troubleshooting steps for {elastic-sec}'s agentless CSPM integration.

[discrete]
== When I make a new integration, how long until the agent appears on the Integration Policies page?

After you create a new agentless integration, the new integration policy may show a button that says **Add agent** instead of the associated agent for several minutes during agent enrollment. No action is needed other than refreshing the page once enrollment is complete.

== How do I troubleshoot an `Offline` agent?*

For agentless integrations to successfully connect to {elastic-sec}, your Fleet server host value must be the default. Otherwise, the agent status that appears on the Fleet page will be `Offline`, and logs will include the error `[elastic_agent][error] Cannot checkin in with fleet-server, retrying`. 

To troubleshoot this issue:

. Find **Fleet** in the navigation menu or use the {kibana-ref}/introduction.html#kibana-navigation-search[global search field]. Go to the **Settings** tab.
. Under **Fleet server hosts**, click the **Actions** button for the policy named `Default`. This opens the Edit Fleet Server flyout. The policy named `Default` should have the **Make this Fleet server the default one** setting enabled. If not, enable it, then delete your integration and create it again.

NOTE: If the **Make this Fleet server the default one** setting was already enabled but problems persist, it's possible someone changed the **URL** value for your default fleet server. In this case, contact Elastic support to find out what the original **URL** value was, update the settings to match this value, then delete your integration and create it again.

== How do I troubleshoot an `Unhealthy` agent?

On the **Fleet** page, the agent associated with an agentless integration will have a name that begins with `agentless`. To troubleshoot an `Unhealthy` agent:

. Confirm that you entered the correct credentials for the cloud provider you're monitoring. The following is an example of an error log resulting from using incorrect AWS credentials:
+ 
```
[elastic_agent.cloudbeat][error] Failed to update registry: failed to get AWS accounts: operation error Organizations: ListAccounts, get identity: get credentials: failed to refresh cached credentials, operation error STS: AssumeRole, https response error StatusCode: 403, RequestID: XXX, api error AccessDenied: User: XXX is not authorized to perform: sts:AssumeRole on resource:XXX
```

For instructions on checking {fleet} logs, refer to {fleet-guide}/fleet-troubleshooting.html[Fleet troubleshooting].

== How do I delete an agentless integration?

NOTE: Deleting your integration will remove all associated resources and stop data ingestion.

When you create a new agentless CSPM integration, a new agent policy appears on the **Agent policies** tab of the **Fleet** page, but you can't use the **Delete integration** button on this page. Instead, you must delete the integration from the CSPM Integration's **Integration policies** tab. 

. Find **Integrations** in the navigation menu or use the {kibana-ref}/introduction.html#kibana-navigation-search[global search field], then search for and select `CSPM`.
. Open the CSPM Integration's **Integration policies** tab.
. Find the integration policy for the integration you want to delete. Click **Actions**, then **Delete integration**.
. Confirm by clicking **Delete integration** again.
