= Cloud Posture dashboard

The Cloud Posture dashboard summarizes how compliant your Kubernetes configuration is with Center for Internet Security (CIS) security benchmarks. To learn how to collect this data, refer to <<get-started-with-kspm, Get started with KSPM>>.

The Cloud Posture dashboard shows:

* Configuration risk metrics for all monitored clusters
* Configuration risk metrics for individual clusters
* Configuration risks grouped by CIS section

It enables you to assess your infrastructure's overall performance against CIS <<benchmark-rules,security benchmarks>>, and to investigate failed findings.

=== Cloud Posture dashboard UI

The first row of cards (Cloud Posture Score, Failed Findings, and Open Cases) summarizes your overall cloud security posture (CSP) by aggregating data from all monitored Kubernetes clusters. Each subsequent row summarizes the CSP of an individual Kubernetes cluster.

The Cloud Posture Score card shows the collective performance of all your monitored clusters over time.

The Failed Findings card shows failed findings grouped by Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmark categories. Click any section name to view its failed findings on the <<findings-page, Findings page>>.

Each row of cards after the first summarizes an individual cluster's CSP. Each row includes the cluster's name, the last 6 digits of its ID, its compliance score, and failed findings grouped by CIS section. When you begin to monitor a new cluster, a new row of cards appears.

=== FAQ

*How long after a new cluster is enrolled will it appear on the dashboard?*
It can take up to 10 minutes for deployment, resource fetching, evaluation, and data processing before an enrolled cluster appears on the posture dashboard.


*How long after a cluster gets unenrolled will it disappear from the dashboard?*
A cluster will disappear as soon as the KSPM integration collects data while that cluster is not enrolled, which means it can take a maximum of four hours to disappear from the dashboard.
