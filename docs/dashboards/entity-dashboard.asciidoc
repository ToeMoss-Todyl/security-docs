The following is required to display the Entity Analytics dashboard: 

* A https://www.elastic.co/pricing/[Platinum subscription] or higher.
* To display host and user risk scores, the host risk score and user risk score features must be enabled. You can do this directly from the dashboard. For more information, refer to Enable host risk score and <<deploy-user-risk-score, Enable user risk score>>.
* To display notable anomalies, the following machine learning jobs must be {ml-docs}/ml-ad-run-jobs.html[installed and run]: 
** `auth_rare_source_ip_for_a_user`
** `suspicious_login_activity`
** `packetbeat_dns_tunneling`
** `packetbeat_rare_server_domain`
** `packetbeat_rare_dns_question`
** `v3_windows_anomalous_script`

The dashboard includes the following sections:

* Entity KPIs 
* Host risk scores
* User risk scores
* Notable anomalies

*Entity KPIs (key performance indicators)*

This chart displays the total number of critical hosts, critical users, and anomalies. Select a link to go to the Host risk table, User risk table, or Anomaly Detection Jobs page. 

*Host risk scores*

This table displays host risk score analytics in your environment, including the total number of hosts, the five most recently recorded host risk scores, their host names, and host risk classification. Host risk scores are calculated using a weighted sum on a scale of 0 to 100.

Interact with the table to filter data or view more details: 

* Select the *Host risk classification* menu to filter the chart by the selected classification. 
* Click a host name link to go to the Host details page.
* Click *View all* in the upper-right to display all host risk information on the Hosts page. 


For more information about host risk scores, click the *Learn more* link in the table, or refer to <<host-risk-score>>. 

*User risk scores* 

This table displays user risk score analytics in your environment, including the total number of users, the five most recently recorded user risk scores, their user names, and user risk classification. Like host risk scores, user risk scores are also calculated using a weighted sum on a scale of 0 to 100.

Interact with the table to filter data or view more details:

* Select the *User risk classification* menu to filter the chart by the selected classification. 
* Click a user name link to go to the User details page. 
* Click *View all* in the upper-right to display all user risk information on the Users page. 

NOTE: The host risk and user risk score tables are not affected by the date and time range.

*Notable anomalies*

Anomalies identify suspicious or irregular behavior patterns. The Notable anomalies table displays the total number of host and user anomalies identified by six predefined {ml} jobs (anomaly name). To display anomaly data, these jobs must be installed and running.

If data is missing, refer to the following: 

 * If the *Run job* link is displayed next to a {ml} job, it's installed but not running. Click the link to go to the Anomaly Detection Jobs page, where you can run the job.  
 * If the  *uninstalled* link is displayed next to a {ml} job, it needs to be installed and run. Click the link to find out how to do this. 

Interact with the table to view more details:

* Click *View all host anomalies* to go to the Anomalies table on the Hosts page.
* Click *View all users anomalies* to go to the Anomalies table on the Users page.
* Click *View all* to display and manage all machine learning jobs on the Anomaly Detection Jobs page.
