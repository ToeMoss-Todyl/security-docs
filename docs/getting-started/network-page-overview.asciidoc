= Network page

The Network page provides key network activity metrics in an interactive map, and network event tables that enable interaction with the Timeline. You
can drag and drop items of interest from the Network view to Timeline for
further investigation.

== Map

The map provides a visual overview of your network traffic. It is interactive, so you can start exploring data directly from the map. Hover over source and destination points to observe more information, such as hostnames and IP addresses.

NOTE: To access the interactive map, you need either `Read` or `All` privileges for `Maps` (*Kibana Privileges* -> *Analytics* -> *Maps*). To learn more about map setup, refer to <<conf-map-ui>>.

To drill down, click a point and use the filter icon to add a field to the filter bar or drag a field to Timeline. You can also click a hostname to jump to the Hosts page, or click an IP address to open its details page.

Just as you can start an investigation using the map, the map refreshes to show relevant data when you run a query or update the time frame.


TIP: To add and remove layers, click on the *Options* menu (*...*) in the top right
corner of the map.

*Widgets and data tables*

Interactive widgets let you drill down for deeper insights:

* Network events
* DNS queries
* Unique flow IDs
* TLS handshakes
* Unique private IPs

There are also tabs for viewing and investigating specific types of data:

* *Flows*: Source and destination IP addresses and countries.
* *DNS*: DNS network queries.
* *HTTP*: Received HTTP requests (HTTP requests for applications using
{apm-app-ref}/apm-getting-started.html[Elastic APM] are monitored by default).
* *TLS*: Handshake details.
* *Anomalies*: Anomalies discovered by <<machine-learning, machine learning jobs>>.
* *Events*: All network events. To display <<det-engine-terminology, alerts>> received from external monitoring tools, scroll down to the Events table and select *Show only external alerts* on the right.

The Events table includes inline actions and several customization options. To learn more about what you can do with the data in these tables, refer to <<alerts-ui-manage>>.


*IP details page*

An IP's details page shows relevant network information for the selected IP address. 

To view an IP's details page, click its IP address link from the Source IPs or Destination IPs table.

The IP's details page includes the following sections: 

* *Summary*: Provides general details such as the location, when the IP address was first and last seen, associated host ID and host name, links to external sites for verifying the IP address's reputation. 
+
NOTE: By default, the external sites are https://talosintelligence.com/[TALOS] and
https://www.virustotal.com/[VIRUSTOTAL]. <<ip-reputation-links>> describes how to configure IP reputation links.
+
* *Alert metrics*: Displays charts that show the total number of alerts by severity, rule, and status (`Open`, `Acknowledged`, or `Closed`).  
+
* *Data tables*: Displays the same data tables on the main Network page, except the values are for the selected user instead of all users.
