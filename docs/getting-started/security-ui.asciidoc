= Elastic Security UI

The {security-app} is a highly interactive workspace designed for security analysts that provides a clear overview of events and alerts from your environment. You can use the interactive UI to drill down into areas of interest.

[[search-overview]]
== Search

Filter for alerts, events, processes, and other important security data by entering *{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language (KQL)]* queries in the search bar, which appears at the top of each page throughout the app. A date/time filter set to `Today` is enabled by default, but can be changed to any time range.

* To refine your search results, select *Add Filter* (image:images/add-filter-icon.png[Add filter icon,17,17]), then enter the field, operator (such as `is not` or `is between`), and value for your filter.

* To save the current KQL query and any applied filters, select *Saved query menu* (image:images/saved-query-menu-icon.png[Saved query menu icon,18,18]), enter a name for the saved query, and select *Save saved query*.

[[page-tabs]]
== Page navigation

The {security-app} contains the following pages that enable analysts to view, analyze, and manage security data:

<<dashboards-overview, *Dashboards*>>: Expand this section to access the Overview, Detection & Response, Kubernetes, and Cloud Posture dashboards, which provide interactive visualizations that summarize specific data within your environment.

<<detection-engine-overview, *Alerts*>>: View and manage alerts to monitor activity within your network.

<<findings-page, *Findings*>>: Review your Kubernetes infrastructureâ€™s performance on a range of security benchmarks.

[role="screenshot"]
image::cloud-native-security/images/findings-page.png[The Findings page]

<<timelines-ui, *Timelines*>>: Investigate alerts and complex threats, such as lateral movement of malware across hosts in your network. Timelines are responsive and allow you to share your findings among other team members.

*Explore*: Expand this section to view the following pages:

* <<hosts-overview, *Hosts*>>: View key metrics for host-related security events through graphs, charts, and interactive data tables.

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/hosts/images/hosts-ov-pg.png[Shows the Hosts page]

* <<network-page-overview, *Network*>>: View key network activity metrics through an interactive map and network event tables that interact with Timeline.

*Get started page*: View a quick shortcut to add security integrations, which you can use to monitor your hosts and ingest data. Other {security-app} pages that show event data (for example, the Hosts and Network pages) display the get started prompt until event data has been ingested.

*Manage*: Expand this section to manage these frequently used tools in the {security-app}:

* <<rules-ui-create, *Rules*>>: Create and manage rules to monitor suspicious events.
* <<detections-ui-exceptions, *Exception lists*>>: View and manage all rule exceptions.
* <<admin-page-ov, *Endpoints*>>. View and manage hosts running {endpoint-cloud-sec}.
* <<policies-page-ov, *Policies*>>: View and manage the integration policies configured for {endpoint-cloud-sec}.
* <<trusted-apps-ov, *Trusted applications*>>: View and manage Windows, macOS, and Linux applications that should be trusted.
* <<event-filters, *Event filters*>> View and manage event filters, which allow you to filter endpoint events you don't need to want stored in {es}.
* <<host-isolation-exceptions, *Host isolation exceptions*>>: View and manage host isolation exceptions, which allow you to specify IP addresses that allow communication with isolated hosts, even when blocked from the rest of your network.
* <<blocklist, *Blocklist*>>: View and manage the blocklist, which allows you to prevent specified applications from running on hosts, extending the list of processes that {endpoint-cloud-sec} considers malicious.
* <<benchmark-rules, *CSP Benchmarks*>>: View, enable or disable benchmark rules.

== Accessibility features

Accessibility features, such as keyboard focus and screen reader support, are built into the Elastic Security UI. These features offer additional ways to navigate the UI and interact with the application.

[[draggable-timeline-elements]]
=== Interact with draggable elements

Use your keyboard to interact with draggable elements in the Elastic Security UI:

* Press the `Tab` key to apply keyboard focus to an element within a table. Or, use your mouse to click on an element and apply keyboard focus to it.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/timeline-accessiblity-keyboard-focus.gif[width=100%][height=100%][Demo that shows how to give a draggable element keyboard focus]

* Press `Enter` on an element with keyboard focus to display its menu and press `Tab` to apply focus sequentially to menu options. The `f`, `o`, `a`, `t`, `c` hotkeys are automatically enabled during this process and offer an alternative way to interact with menu options.

[role="screenshot"]

* If an event has an event renderer, press the `Shift` key and the down directional arrow to apply keyboard focus to the event renderer and `Tab` or `Shift` + `Tab` to navigate between fields. To return to the cells in the current row, press the up directional arrow. To move to the next row, press the down directional arrow.

=== Navigate the Elastic Security UI
Use your keyboard to navigate through rows, columns, and menu options in the Elastic Security UI:

* Use the directional arrows to move keyboard focus right, left, up, and down in a table.

[role="screenshot"]
