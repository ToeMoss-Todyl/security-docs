*User Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) charts*

KPI charts show the total number of users, and successful and failed user authentications, and unique IPs based on the time range specified in the date picker. Data in the KPI charts is visualized through linear and bar graphs.

TIP: Place your cursor inside one of the KPI charts to view the actions menu (*...*), where you can perform these actions: inspect, open in Lens, add to a new case, and attach to an existing case.

*Data tables*

Beneath the KPI charts are data tables, which are useful for viewing and investigating specific types of data. Select the relevant tab to view the following details:

* *All users*: A chronological list of unique user names, the time they were last seen, and the associated domain.
* *Authentications*: Authentication events
* *Anomalies*: Unusual activity discovered by machine learning jobs that contain user data
* *Events*: Ingested events that contain the `user.name` field. You can stack by `event.action`, `event.dataset`, or `event.module` fields.
* *External alerts*: Alerts received from external monitoring tools. You can stack by `event.module` and `event.category` fields.
