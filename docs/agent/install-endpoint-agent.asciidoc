== Install the Endpoint agent

Currently, installation of the Elastic Endpoint app is performed through a separate agent from the Elastic agent.

=== Gain access to endpoint agent

Review the https://www.elastic.co/support_policy/endpoint-system-requirements[Elastic Endpoint Security System Requirements]. Then contact Elastic support to gain access to the beta version of the endpoint agent.

Installation of the agent on your endpoint also installs the Endpoint sensor.

=== (Mac) Enable full disk access

Windows and Linux endpoints work with the Endpoint sensor by default. However, after installing the sensor on either macOS 10.14 Mojave or 10.15 Catalina, you must enable a setting called "Full Disk
Access" to provide the sensor the ability to analyze files that are in your home directory.

To enable full disk access:

1. Open the System Preferences application.
2. Click Security and Privacy. On the Security and Privacy panel, select the Privacy tab.
3. In the left pane, select Full Disk Access.
4. In the lower-left corner of the panel, click the Lock button and enter your username and password. The lock then
should appear unlocked.
5. Click the + button to view the file finder. Navigate to the ``/Library/Endgame` directory, select the `esensor` file, and then click *Open*.
6. In the Privacy tab, confirm that the `esensor` file appears in the list of applications that have full access
permission, as seen in the following image:

The sensor now has full access to the file system.
