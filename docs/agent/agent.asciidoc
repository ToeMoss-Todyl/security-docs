= Endpoint agent

Through the Elastic Endpoint agent, Endpoint instantly detects and stops privilege escalation, defense evasion,
malicious persistence, credential access, and propagation. Integration with the SIEM app provides further event reporting, allowing for:

- Accelerated endpoint detection and response
- In-band and out-of-band sensor deployment

The Endpoint agent's advanced sensor technology allows a security analyst or IT professional to choose to install a persistent sensor for long-term protection or a dissolvable sensor for minimal endpoint footprint.
