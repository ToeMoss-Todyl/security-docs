== Enable full disk access

Elastic cloud users can take advantage of Endgame's detection sensor. However, after installing the sensor on either macOS 10.14 Mojave or 10.15 Catalina, you must enable a setting called **Full Disk
Access** so the sensor can analyze files that are in your home directory.
