= Elastic Security overview

{elastic-sec} combines threat detection analytics, cloud native security, and endpoint protection capabilities in a single solution, so you can quickly detect, investigate, and respond to threats and vulnerabilities across your environment.

Elastic Security provides:

* A detection engine that identifies a wide range of threats
* A workspace for event triage, investigation, and case management
* Interactive data visualization tools 
* Integrations for collecting data from various sources
