*Host KPI charts*

KPI charts show data metrics for hosts, user authentications, and unique IPs based on the time range specified in the date picker. Data in the KPI charts is depicted via linear or bar graphs.

NOTE: The default time range is within the last 15 minutes.

*Data tables*

Beneath the KPI charts are data tables, categorized by individual tabs, which are useful for viewing and investigating specific types of data. Select the relevant tab to view the following data:

* *All hosts*: High-level host details.
* *Authentications*: Authentication events.
* *Uncommon processes*: Uncommon processes running on hosts.
* *Anomalies*: Anomalies discovered by machine learning jobs.
* *Events*: All host events.
* *External alerts*: Alerts received from external monitoring tools.
* *Sessions*: Linux process events that you can open in Session View, an investigation tool that allows you to examine Linux process data at a hierarchal level.

The tables within the *Events*, *External alerts* and *Sessions* tabs are interactive and provide several customization options. To learn more about how to analyze information in these tables, refer to <<alerts-ui-manage>>.


*Add data values to the Timeline*

You can add any highlighted value in the data tables to a Timeline query by dragging and dropping the value from the table to the *Timeline* bar at the bottom of the page. You can also select the *Add to timeline investigation* inline option if you hover over a highlighted value in the table. If the Timeline view is already open, drag and drop the value to the *Query* box. Repeat to add additional fields to the query, or click *+Add Field* in the Timeline view.
