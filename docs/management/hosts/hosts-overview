== Hosts page overview
The Hosts page provides a comprehensive overview of all hosts and host-related security events. Key Performance Indicator (KPI) charts, data tables, and interactive widgets let you view specific data, drill down for deeper insights, and interact with the Timeline Event Viewer for further investigation.

*Search and filter hosts*
The top of the Hosts page displays the `Search` bar so you can search and filter for hosts. To the right of the Search bar is a date picker, which lets you select a specific date and time range. 

*Host Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) charts*
KPI charts show data metrics for hosts, user authentications, and unique IPs based on the time range specified in the date picker. Data in the KPI charts is depicted via linear or bar graphs.
NOTE: The default time range is the last 15 minutes.

*Data tables*
Beneath the KPI charts are data tables, categorized by individual tabs, for viewing and investigating specific types of data. Select a tab to view the following data:

* All hosts: high-level host details
* Authentications: authentication events
* Uncommon processes: uncommon processes running on hosts
* Anomalies: anomalies discovered by machine learning jobs
* Events: all host events
* External alerts: alerts received from external monitoring tools

*Add data values to the Timeline*
You can add any highlighted value in the data tables to a Timeline query by dragging and dropping the value from the table to the `Timeline` tab on the rightmost side of the page. If the Timeline pane is already open, drag and drop the value to the `Query` box. Repeat to add additional fields to the query, or click `+Add Field` in the Timeline pane.
