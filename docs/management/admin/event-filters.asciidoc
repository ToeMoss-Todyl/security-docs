= Event filters

Event filters allow admins to filter endpoint events that you do not need or want stored in {es} - for example, those that have a high volume or are unhelpful. With event filters, you can optimize your storage in {es}. All endpoint events have the `endpoint.events.network` field.

You can create event filters from the Event filters page or from the Hosts page.


. To create an event filter via the Hosts page:
.. Go to *Explore* -> *Hosts*. 
.. Select the *Events* tab to view the Events table.
+
TIP: Since you can only create filters for endpoint events, be sure to filter the Events table to events generated by the Elastic Endpoint. +
In the KQL search bar, enter the following query: `event.dataset : endpoint.events.network`.
+
.. Find the event for which to create a filter, click the *More Actions* button (*...*), then click *Add Endpoint event filter*.
. To create an event filter via the Event filter page:
.. Go to *Manage* -> *Event filters*. The *Add event filter* flyout opens.

. Enter a name for the event filter.
. If necessary, modify the pre-populated conditions.


Add conditions that define when the {security-app} filters events. You can define multiple conditions with `OR` and `AND` relationships. In the image above, the event filter filters out events whose `event.category` field is `network`, and whose `process.executable` field is the same as the specified path.
