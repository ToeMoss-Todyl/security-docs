= Endpoint protection rules

Endpoint protection rules are prebuilt rules designed to help you manage and respond to alerts generated by {elastic-defend}. These include the <<endpoint-security, {elastic-defend}>> rule as well as additional detection and prevention rules for different {elastic-defend} protection features.

== {elastic-defend} rule

The {elastic-defend} rule automatically creates an alert from all incoming Elastic Endpoint alerts. To receive Elastic Endpoint alerts, you must install the Endpoint agent on your hosts (see <<install-endpoint>>).

When this rule is enabled, the following Endpoint events are displayed as detection alerts:

** Malware Prevention Alert
** Malware Detection Alert

NOTE: When you load the prebuilt rules, this is the only rule that is enabled by default.

== Feature-specific protection rules

The following endpoint protection rules give you more granular control over how you handle the generated alerts. These rules are tailored for each of {elastic-defend}'s endpoint protection featuresâ€”malware, ransomware, memory threats, and malicious behavior. Enabling these rules allows you to configure more specific actions based on the protection feature and whether the malicious activity was prevented or detected.

* Behavior - Detected - Elastic Defend
* Behavior - Prevented - Endpoint Defend
* Malicious File - Detected - Elastic Defend
* Malicious File - Prevented - Elastic Defend
* Memory Signature - Detected - Elastic Defend
* Memory Signature - Prevented - Elastic Defend
* Ransomware - Detected - Elastic Defend
* Ransomware - Prevented - Elastic Defend

To use these rules, you need to manually enable them on the **Rules** page of the {security-app}. Follow the instructions for <<load-prebuilt-rules,installing and enabling Elastic prebuilt rules>>.

== Exception handling

All endpoint protection rules share a common exception list called Endpoint Security Exception List. This ensures that if you switch between using the {elastic-defend} rule and the feature-specific protection rules, your existing exceptions continue to apply.
