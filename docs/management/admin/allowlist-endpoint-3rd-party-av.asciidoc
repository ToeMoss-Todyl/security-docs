= Allowlist Elastic Endpoint in third-party antivirus apps

Third-party antivirus (AV) applications may identify the expected behavior of {elastic-endpoint} as a potential threat. Add {elastic-endpoint}'s digital signatures and file paths to your AV software's allowlist to ensure {elastic-endpoint} continues to function as intended. 

NOTE: Your AV software may refer to allowlisted processes as process exclusions, ignored processes, or trusted processes.

NOTE: We recommend you allowlist both the file paths and digital signatures, if applicable.
