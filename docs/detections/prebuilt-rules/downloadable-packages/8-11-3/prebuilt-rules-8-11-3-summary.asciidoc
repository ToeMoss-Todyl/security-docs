|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-masquerading-space-after-filename, Masquerading Space After Filename>> | This rules identifies a process created from an executable with a space appended to the end of the filename. This may indicate an attempt to masquerade a malicious file as benign to gain user execution. When a space is added to the end of certain files, the OS will execute the file according to it's true filetype instead of it's extension. Adversaries can hide a program's true filetype by changing the extension of the file. They can then add a space to the end of the name so that the OS automatically executes the file when it's double-clicked. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-timestomping-using-touch-command, Timestomping using Touch Command>> | Timestomping is an anti-forensics technique which is used to modify the timestamps of a file, often to mimic files that are in the same folder. | update | 104

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-system-binary-copied-and-or-moved-to-suspicious-directory, System Binary Copied and/or Moved to Suspicious Directory>> | This rule monitors for the copying or moving of a system binary to a suspicious directory. Adversaries may copy/move and rename system binaries to evade detection. Copying a system binary to a different location should not occur often, so if it does, the activity should be investigated. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-file-made-immutable-by-chattr, File made Immutable by Chattr>> | Detects a file being made immutable using the chattr binary. Making a file immutable means it cannot be deleted or renamed, no link can be created to this file, most of the file's metadata can not be modified, and the file can not be opened in write mode. Threat actors will commonly utilize this to prevent tampering or modification of their malicious files or any system files they have modified for purposes of persistence (e.g .ssh, /etc/passwd, etc.). | update | 109 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-potential-disabling-of-apparmor, Potential Disabling of AppArmor>> | This rule monitors for potential attempts to disable AppArmor. AppArmor is a Linux security module that enforces fine-grained access control policies to restrict the actions and resources that specific applications and processes can access. Adversaries may disable security tools to avoid possible detection of their tools and activities. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-potential-disabling-of-selinux, Potential Disabling of SELinux>> | Identifies potential attempts to disable Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux), which is a Linux kernel security feature to support access control policies. Adversaries may disable security tools to avoid possible detection of their tools and activities. | update | 107 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-esxi-timestomping-using-touch-command, ESXI Timestomping using Touch Command>> | Identifies instances where the 'touch' command is executed on a Linux system with the "-r" flag, which is used to modify the timestamp of a file based on another file's timestamp. The rule targets specific VM-related paths, such as "/etc/vmware/", "/usr/lib/vmware/", or "/vmfs/*". These paths are associated with VMware virtualization software, and their presence in the touch command arguments may indicate that a threat actor is attempting to tamper with timestamps of VM-related files and configurations on the system. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-file-deletion-via-shred, File Deletion via Shred>> | Malware or other files dropped or created on a system by an adversary may leave traces behind as to what was done within a network and how. Adversaries may remove these files over the course of an intrusion to keep their footprint low or remove them at the end as part of the post-intrusion cleanup process. | update | 107 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-file-permission-modification-in-writable-directory, File Permission Modification in Writable Directory>> | Identifies file permission modifications in common writable directories by a non-root user. Adversaries often drop files or payloads into a writable directory and change permissions prior to execution. | update | 207 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-creation-of-hidden-files-and-directories-via-commandline, Creation of Hidden Files and Directories via CommandLine>> | Users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a "." as the first character in the file or folder name. Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders on the system for persistence and defense evasion. This rule looks for hidden files or folders in common writable directories. | update | 107 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-creation-of-hidden-shared-object-file, Creation of Hidden Shared Object File>> | Identifies the creation of a hidden shared object (.so) file. Users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a "." as the first character in the file or folder name. Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders on the system for persistence and defense evasion. | update | 108 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-kernel-module-removal, Kernel Module Removal>> | Kernel modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. This rule identifies attempts to remove a kernel module. | update | 107 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-system-log-file-deletion, System Log File Deletion>> | Identifies the deletion of sensitive Linux system logs. This may indicate an attempt to evade detection or destroy forensic evidence on a system. | update | 109 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-potential-hidden-process-via-mount-hidepid, Potential Hidden Process via Mount Hidepid>> | Identifies the execution of mount process with hidepid parameter, which can make processes invisible to other users from the system. Adversaries using Linux kernel version 3.2+ (or RHEL/CentOS v6.5+ above) can hide the process from other users. When hidepid=2 option is executed to mount the /proc filesystem, only the root user can see all processes and the logged-in user can only see their own process. This provides a defense evasion mechanism for the adversaries to hide their process executions from all other commands such as ps, top, pgrep and more. With the Linux kernel hardening hidepid option all the user has to do is remount the /proc filesystem with the option, which can now be monitored and detected. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-potential-defense-evasion-via-proot, Potential Defense Evasion via PRoot>> | Identifies the execution of the PRoot utility, an open-source tool for user-space implementation of chroot, mount --bind, and binfmt_misc. Adversaries can leverage an open-source tool PRoot to expand the scope of their operations to multiple Linux distributions and simplify their necessary efforts. In a normal threat scenario, the scope of an attack is limited by the varying configurations of each Linux distribution. With PRoot, it provides an attacker with a consistent operational environment across different Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Alpine. PRoot also provides emulation capabilities that allow for malware built on other architectures, such as ARM, to be run.The post-exploitation technique called bring your own filesystem (BYOF), can be used by the threat actors to execute malicious payload or elevate privileges or perform network scans or orchestrate another attack on the environment. Although PRoot was originally not developed with malicious intent it can be easily tuned to work for one. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-suspicious-renaming-of-esxi-files, Suspicious Renaming of ESXI Files>> | Identifies instances where VMware-related files, such as those with extensions like ".vmdk", ".vmx", ".vmxf", ".vmsd", ".vmsn", ".vswp", ".vmss", ".nvram", and ".vmem", are renamed on a Linux system.

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-suspicious-renaming-of-esxi-index-html-file, Suspicious Renaming of ESXI index.html File>> | Identifies instances where the "index.html" file within the "/usr/lib/vmware/*" directory is renamed on a Linux system. The rule monitors for the "rename" event action associated with this specific file and path, which could indicate malicious activity. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-esxi-discovery-via-find, ESXI Discovery via Find>> | Identifies instances where the 'find' command is started on a Linux system with arguments targeting specific VM-related paths, such as "/etc/vmware/", "/usr/lib/vmware/", or "/vmfs/*". These paths are associated with VMware virtualization software, and their presence in the find command arguments may indicate that a threat actor is attempting to search for, analyze, or manipulate VM-related files and configurations on the system. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-esxi-discovery-via-grep, ESXI Discovery via Grep>> | Identifies instances where a process named 'grep', 'egrep', or 'pgrep' is started on a Linux system with arguments related to virtual machine (VM) files, such as "vmdk", "vmx", "vmxf", "vmsd", "vmsn", "vswp", "vmss", "nvram", or "vmem". These file extensions are associated with VM-related file formats, and their presence in grep command arguments may indicate that a threat actor is attempting to search for, analyze, or manipulate VM files on the system. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-enumeration-of-kernel-modules, Enumeration of Kernel Modules>> | Loadable Kernel Modules (or LKMs) are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. This identifies attempts to enumerate information about a kernel module. | update | 207 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-hping-process-activity, Hping Process Activity>> | Hping ran on a Linux host. Hping is a FOSS command-line packet analyzer and has the ability to construct network packets for a wide variety of network security testing applications, including scanning and firewall auditing. | update | 107 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-nping-process-activity, Nping Process Activity>> | Nping ran on a Linux host. Nping is part of the Nmap tool suite and has the ability to construct raw packets for a wide variety of security testing applications, including denial of service testing. | update | 107 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-potential-network-scan-executed-from-host, Potential Network Scan Executed From Host>> | This threshold rule monitors for the rapid execution of unix utilities that are capable of conducting network scans. Adversaries may leverage built-in tools such as ping, netcat or socat to execute ping sweeps across the network while attempting to evade detection or due to the lack of network mapping tools available on the compromised host. | update | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-potential-pspy-process-monitoring-detected, Potential Pspy Process Monitoring Detected>> | This rule leverages auditd to monitor for processes scanning different processes within the /proc directory using the openat syscall. This is a strong indication for the usage of the pspy utility. Attackers may leverage the pspy process monitoring utility to monitor system processes without requiring root permissions, in order to find potential privilege escalation vectors. | update | 4 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-sudo-command-enumeration-detected, Sudo Command Enumeration Detected>> | This rule monitors for the usage of the sudo -l command, which is used to list the allowed and forbidden commands for the invoking user. Attackers may execute this command to enumerate commands allowed to be executed with sudo permissions, potentially allowing to escalate privileges to root. | update | 4 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-suid-sguid-enumeration-detected, SUID/SGUID Enumeration Detected>> | This rule monitors for the usage of the "find" command in conjunction with SUID and SGUID permission arguments. SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) are special permissions in Linux that allow a program to execute with the privileges of the file owner or group, respectively, rather than the privileges of the user running the program. In case an attacker is able to enumerate and find a binary that is misconfigured, they might be able to leverage this misconfiguration to escalate privileges by exploiting vulnerabilities or built-in features in the privileged program. | update | 4 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-unusual-user-privilege-enumeration-via-id, Unusual User Privilege Enumeration via id>> | This rule monitors for a sequence of 20 "id" command executions within 1 second by the same parent process. This behavior is unusual, and may be indicative of the execution of an enumeration script such as LinPEAS or LinEnum. These scripts leverage the "id" command to enumerate the privileges of all users present on the system. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-virtual-machine-fingerprinting, Virtual Machine Fingerprinting>> | An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating system and hardware. This rule identifies common locations used to discover virtual machine hardware by a non-root user. This technique has been used by the Pupy RAT and other malware. | update | 107 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-abnormal-process-id-or-lock-file-created, Abnormal Process ID or Lock File Created>> | Identifies the creation of a Process ID (PID), lock or reboot file created in temporary file storage paradigm (tmpfs) directory /var/run. On Linux, the PID files typically hold the process ID to track previous copies running and manage other tasks. Certain Linux malware use the /var/run directory for holding data, executables and other tasks, disguising itself or these files as legitimate PID files. | update | 211 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-potential-curl-cve-2023-38545-exploitation, Potential curl CVE-2023-38545 Exploitation>> | Detects potential exploitation of curl CVE-2023-38545 by monitoring for vulnerable command line arguments in conjunction with an unusual command line length. A flaw in curl version <= 8.3 makes curl vulnerable to a heap based buffer overflow during the SOCKS5 proxy handshake. Upgrade to curl version >= 8.4 to patch this vulnerability. This exploit can be executed with and without the use of environment variables. For increased visibility, enable the collection of http_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY and ALL_PROXY environment variables based on the instructions provided in the setup guide of this rule. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-file-creation-execution-and-self-deletion-in-suspicious-directory, File Creation, Execution and Self-Deletion in Suspicious Directory>> | This rule monitors for the creation of a file, followed by its execution and self-deletion in a short timespan within a directory often used for malicious purposes by threat actors. This behavior is often used by malware to execute malicious code and delete itself to hide its tracks. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-3-file-transfer-or-listener-established-via-netcat, File Transfer or Listener Established via Netcat>> | A netcat process is engaging in network activity on a Linux host. Netcat is often used as a persistence mechanism by exporting a reverse shell or by serving a shell on a listening port. Netcat is also sometimes used for data exfiltration. | update | 109
