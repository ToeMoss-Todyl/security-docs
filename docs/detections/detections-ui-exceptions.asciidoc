== Rule exceptions

Rule exceptions can be associated with detection and endpoint rules to prevent those rules from generating alerts under specific circumstances. You can use exceptions to reduce the number of false positives, and to prevent trusted processes and network activity from generating unnecessary alerts.

When creating exceptions, you can assign them to <<rule-exceptions-intro,individual rules>> or share them among <<shared-exception-lists,multiple rules>>.

=== Exceptions for individual rules

Exceptions, also referred to as _exception items_, contain the source event conditions that determine when alerts should or should not be generated. 

You can create exceptions that apply exclusively to a single rule. These types of exceptions cannot be used by other rules and you must manage them from the ruleâ€™s details page. To learn more about creating and managing these types of exceptions, refer to <<add-exceptions>>.

NOTE: You can also use <<value-lists-exceptions,value lists>> to define exceptions for detection rules. Value lists allow you to match an exception against a list of possible values.

[[shared-exception-list-intro]]
=== Shared exception lists

If you want an exception to apply to multiple rules, you can add an exception to a shared exception list. Shared exception lists allow you to group exceptions together and then associated them with multiple rules. Refer to <<shared-exception-lists>>Create and manage shared exception lists to learn more.
