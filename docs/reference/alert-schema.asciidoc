[[alert-schema]]

== Alert schema

{elastic-sec} stores alerts that have been generated by detection rules in hidden {es} indices.  In 7.x versions, the index pattern was `.siem-signals-<spacename>-*`.  In 8.x versions, the index pattern is `.alerts-security.alerts-<spacename>-*`, and the field names have changed. The following table includes the new names and provides a cross-reference to the previous field names.

NOTE: Users are advised NOT to use the `_source field` in alert documents, but rather use the fields API to programmatically obtain the list of fields used in these documents. Learn more about {ref}/search-fields.html[retrieving selected fields from a search].
