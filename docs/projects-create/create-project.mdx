A Serverless project allows you to run ((elastic-sec)) in an autoscaled and fully-managed environment, where you don't have to manage the underlying ((es)) cluster and ((kib)) instances.

1. Navigate to [cloud.elastic.co](https://cloud.elastic.co/).

1. Log in to your ((ecloud)) account and select **Create project** from the **Fully-managed projects** panel.

1. Select **Next** from the **Security** panel.

1. Edit your project settings. (Click **Edit settings** to access all settings.)

    * **Name**: A unique name for your project.

    * **Cloud provider**: The cloud platform where you’ll deploy your project. We currently support Amazon Web Services (AWS).

    * **Region**: The cloud platform’s region where your project will live. The region should be as close as possible to the location of your data.

    You can also check [the pricing details](https://cloud.elastic.co/pricing) to see how you consume ((elastic-sec)) Serverless.

1. Select **Create project**. It takes a few minutes before your project gets created. 

1. Once the project is ready, select **Continue** to open the **Get started** page. (You might need to log into ((ecloud)) again.) 

    From here, you can learn more about ((elastic-sec)) features and start setting up your workspace.
